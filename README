Slider is a simple Ruby module to allow a presenter to create and view a
slideshow using only a terminal emulator. It requires the use of the console
application 'figlet' to draw the fancy headings.

Configuration:

- Set the # of columns in your terminal window (default is 80).
set_columns 105

- Set the # of rows in your terminal window (default is 24).
set_rows 30

Create slides:
- Set the header (first argument), and sub-points (subsequent arguments) each
separated by a comma.

slide "Slider", "It's cool!"

Run the show:

start_slideshow
